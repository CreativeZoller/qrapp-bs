# TODO list for the QR Code generator

## _Current version 0.0.1_

build badge's future place

Qrapp-bs is currently in an MVP state. There could be a lot of bugs, which would need issues to be created on github. However this documentation is only for listing purposes for the work to be done or would be good to have features, developments, additions, etc.

## Work to be done

- check and fix the template-part validation message malfunctions
- check and fix clear/reset post style issues with form field validation
- add Husky pre-commit check
- add project to TravisCI, if working properly, add badge to the top section of this document
- add proper download functionality as PNG image
- dynamically generate timestamp at drawing time to show under preview image
- add advanced options to the create form
- add proper validation to the advanced parts
- add proper unit testing with Jest to the project
- add coverage report after unit testing is properly implemented
- add multilingual support to the app

With each and every bugfix and new feature added, a new release should be done as path release. Once the MVP is finalized with the correct core functions, a minor version release should be made.
